# Digital-Camera-Bayes-Filter-Colour-Demosaic
In this implementation, we are performing image demosaicing on a colour image captured by a digital camera with a Bayer â€€Filter mosaic. 
The primary goal is to reconstruct a full-color image from the raw sensor data, while maintaining the best possible image quality in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared to the ground truth image.
